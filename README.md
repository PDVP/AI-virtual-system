We know that Mouse and Keyboard is one of the amazing inventions of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technology. Currently, wireless mouse or a Bluetooth mouse/keyboard uses some other dependent devices and is not completely free as it uses a battery for power and a dongle to connect it to the Laptop. 
In our, AI virtual system, this limitation can be overcome by using webcam or a built-in camera for capturing of hand tips and hand gestures detection and voice using computer vision and other libraries for processing the field signals. The algorithm used in the system makes use of the machine learning algorithm. Based on the hand gestures and voice commands, the computer can be controlled virtually and can perform left click, right click, scrolling functions, and computer cursor function without the use of the physical mouse and keyboard.
